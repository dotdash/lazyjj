## Setup

Make sure you have [`jj`](https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) installed first.

- With [`cargo binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall): `cargo binstall blazingjj`
- With `cargo install`: `cargo install blazingjj --locked` (may take a few moments to compile)
- With pre-built binaries: [View releases](https://github.com/blazingjj/blazingjj/releases)

To build and install a pre-release version: `cargo install --git https://github.com/blazingjj/blazingjj.git --locked`

## Configuration

You can optionally configure the following options through your jj config:

- `blazingjj.highlight-color`: Changes the highlight color. Can use named colors. Defaults to `#323264`
- `blazingjj.diff-format`: Change the default diff format. Can be `color-words` or `git`. Defaults to `color_words`
  - If `blazingjj.diff-format` is not set but `ui.diff.format` is, the latter will be used
- `blazingjj.diff-tool`: Specify which diff tool to use by default
  - If `blazingjj.diff-tool` is not set but `ui.diff.tool` is, the latter will be used
- `blazingjj.bookmark-template`: Change the bookmark name template for generated bookmark names. Defaults to `'push-' ++ change_id.short()`
  - If `blazingjj.bookmark-template` is not set but `templates.git_push_bookmark` is, the latter will be used
- `blazingjj.layout`: Changes the layout of the main and details panel. Can be `horizontal` (default) or `vertical`
- `blazingjj.layout-percent`: Changes the layout split of the main page. Should be number between 0 and 100. Defaults to `50`

Example: `jj config set --user blazingjj.diff-format "color-words"` (for storing in [user config file](https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/latest/config/#user-config-file), repo config is also supported)

## Usage

To start blazingjj for the repository in the current directory: `blazingjj`

To use a different repository: `blazingjj --path ~/path/to/repo`

To start with a different default revset: `blazingjj -r '::@'`

## Development

### Setup

1. Install Rust and
2. Clone repository
3. Run with `cargo run`
4. Build with `cargo build --release` (output in `target/release`)
5. You can point it to another jj repo with `--path`: `cargo run -- --path ~/other-repo`

### Logging/Tracing

blazingjj has 2 debugging tools:

1. Logging: Enabled by setting `BLAZINGJJ_LOG=1` when running. Produces a `blazingjj.log` log file
2. Tracing: Enabled by setting `BLAZINGJJ_TRACE=1` when running. Produces `trace-*.json` Chrome trace file, for `chrome://tracing` or [ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev)
